# AdventOfCode2024

Hi, welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository.

My goal this year is to discover and practice Rust, I'll see how far I'll go with it.

## Getting started

Contrary to last year, where I sometime tried to submit a solution around midnight, this year I'll go for clean code, and I'm sleeping at midnight so I'll work on the puzzle sometime during the day.

## Licensing

Pretty much all my code is usually under CC BY-NC-SA

## Contributing

No need to contribute, especially considering this repo is just mirroring my private GitLab server's repository.

## Acknowledgement

I'll probably put some links around here to the repositories that my friends are using.
